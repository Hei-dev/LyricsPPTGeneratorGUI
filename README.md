# LyricsPPTGeneratorGUI
A windows application to automatically generate lyrics slide, using C# and Office Interop

This is a continuation of my Python script, which is based on python pptx. However, as the project grows, a better support for implementing PowerPoint generation is needed. Hence, I have switched to .NET as there is an offical MS Office API available.

The new program have better support for making a powerpoint presentation, with the offical API from Microsoft. This means that new features can be implemented easier. This includes text glow color.

The application has also made an upgrade to having a Graphical User Interface(GUI). This would make the program more accessible to users that does not want to follow the format because it is too complicated (which is basically everyone)

## Software Required
To generate the PowerPoint, Microsoft Office (Preferably 2013 or later, only tested with Microsoft 365 Version) must be installed in the computer

## Get the application
The app is available under the release tab. Users can download and extract the attached zip file, and run setup.exe.
